		<center>Good and safe sex is good for one’s mental health. We want to focus our research on defining these terms of “good” “safe” and “better” sex. We want our target audience, ages 15-24, to understand the science of sexual chemistry, formulas for positive sexual experiences and ways to enrich sexual experience. 
In addition to opening the doors and windows of information flow, we want to have interactive conversation between the users of the website. Conversation, or the lack of, around sex and sexual experience is a large focus for this project, therefore we want to design a web forum where individuals can ask one another questions, post stories, humorous and serious alike, and learn from one another’s ways of coping emotionally through sexual empowerment. However we do not see this being a “profile” type forum; we would like for users only to connect through a question/comment basis.</center>
		
		<p>It will be interesting to learn about the benefits of having sex meanwhile drawing out an understanding of why people are so uncomfortable about this subject. To compare students’ sexual education and experiences based on geography, upbringing, sexuality, future aspirations and overall “mental health” will offer insight to us as researchers but also us as curious, young individuals, living in this same tight-lipped world.</p>


		<p>Sex is a dirty word; it’s not spoken of freely. Although we live in an age of a highly sexualized culture, adults are afraid to engage their children in conversation about sex. Apart from sex education courses in public school (these varying in degrees of “effectiveness” and ideology) young people are never given facts about the benefits of sexual activity. We hypothesized that teens and young adults, if given access to the health benefits of good and safe sex, will become invested in the positive, self-healing properties of their own bodies and not look towards drugs and alcohol to supplement negative emotions in these formative years of adolescence. </p>
		
		<p>The barriers blocking the flow of information from adults to children about sex and it’s benefits are many; some parents that are raising/have raised children in the last decade are still of a generation where abstinence and the church reigned over moral. “Sex, drugs and RocknRoll” -- It’s meaning still holds true in the minds of those who gave it meaning at the start. Sex before and even outside of marriage is still demonized in many cultures. Fear for one’s spiritual well-being muddies the understanding of the body and it’s capabilities to regulate hormones through positive sexual experiences.</p>

		<p>12 Shocking Sex Facts</p>
<p>Masters and Johnson revolutionized sex research in the 1950s, 60s and 70s. Here what we're learning about sex now.</p>
<p>By Eliana Dockterman @edocktermanOct. 04, 2013
William Masters and Virginia Johnson became famous for the groundbreaking sex research they conducted at Washington University in St. Louis in the 1950s and 1960s—so famous, in fact, that Showtime decided to turn their story into a new drama series, Masters of Sex. Masters and Johnson’s discoveries changed the way we think about sex and about women’s sexuality in particular. Their studies showed that women were capable of multiple orgasms, among other things. These were revolutionary ideas the time, but new research about women and sex has revealed some facts that would shock even Masters and Johnson. Here’s the latest on sex research from Dr. Eden Fromberg of SoHo OBGYN and Naomi Wolf’s most recent book, Vagina: A New Biography.</p>
<p>1. Cycles of light affect our fertility
Women used to menstruate during the new moon (when it’s dark at night) and ovulate during a full moon (when it’s light). Now, in a world full of artificial lighting and bright screens, women are not as in tune with the connection between their biology and nature. Some have tried “lunaception,” altering the lights in their bedrooms based on the moon lighting to change their ovulation.</p>
<p>2. Women can get pregnant five to eight days after having sex
Studies have shown that some sperm can live in the cervical mucus crypt before the egg is actually fertilized for anywhere from five to eight days after sex.</p>
<p>3. Wearing high heels can negatively affect a woman’s orgasm
Certain high-end shoe brands developed the arch in their high-heeled shoes to approximate the arch in a woman’s pelvis when she is having an orgasm. The heels create a contraction in the pelvic floor, which is problematic because the pelvic floor then cannot contract further during orgasm. “An orgasm is usually like going from zero to 60,” explains Fromberg. “If you’re already at 55 [from wearing heels], you’re not going to have a full experience.”</p>
<p>4. Orgasms can make women more creative
Studies have shown that orgasms can make women more confident, productive and creative. And it’s a feedback loop—women achieve fuller orgasms when they are being creative.</p>
<p>5. Birth control pills dampen the libido
Any hormonal contraception has that psychological side effect. Sometimes women even have trouble conceiving once they’re off the pill because while they may have been attracted to their partner on the pill, they’re not actually compatible with each other biochemically without the extra hormones.</p>
<p>6.  Sitting in chairs can arouse women
Pudendal nerves, underneath the buttox and the sitting bones, feed arousal tissues (in the vagina, clitoris, anus, etc.). Sitting in a certain kind of chair pressing on the pudendal nerves in a certain way can lead to sexual arousal.</p>
<p>7. …But it can also dampen their orgasms
On the other hand, sitting in chairs for most of the day shortens the pelvic floor and psoas muscles—muscles which are essential to a full-body orgasm. When these muscles are tight from sitting too much, women find it harder to achieve a great orgasm.</p>
<p>8. Women have three erogenous zones 
The clitoris, the G Spot, AND the opening of the cervix. Some argue nipples belong on that list too.</p>
<p>9. Nerve endings are distributed differently in every woman’s vagina
Like a snowflake, each woman is unique in that her nerve endings are distributed in her genitalia differently than anyone else. That means, every woman needs to employ slightly different methods to achieve orgasm.</p>
<p>10. The pulsations a woman feels during orgasm are actually her uterus trying to gather sperm
Round ligaments that end in the labia majora “rock the uterus back and forth during orgasm so that the cervix has the opportunity to potentially scoop semen up that may have pooled in the back of the vagina to enhance fertility,” says Fromberg.</p>
<p>11. Being well hydrated leads to better orgasms
Because the body is mostly fluid, being hydrated enhances people’s ability to achieve orgasm.</p>
<p>12. All woman can achieve orgasm
Almost no woman was born unable to achieve an orgasm. “Women have the innate machinery programmed to have orgasms,” Fromberg explains. “But not everybody learns how to use that machinery well.”</p>
<p>5 studies that offer fascinating conclusions about human sexuality
The standard narrative of human sexual evolution says: men provide women with goods and services in exchange for women’s sexual fidelity. But is that really true or relevant today? Christopher Ryan, the co-author of Sex at Dawn with Cacilda Jethá, takes a deeper look and has quite a few bones to pick with this idea.
Ryan explains that our sexual patterns are an outgrowth of agricultural models—which accounts for only about five percent of human history. For the other 95 percent, human sexuality was “a way of establishing and maintaining the complex flexible social systems, networks, that our ancestors were very good at.” In hunter-gatherer societies, there were overlapping sexual relationships between members of a community—a more fluid system than the Victorian model we’re wedded to today. In fact, several contemporary societies around the world argue against the sexual myth we’ve built up, too.
“My hope is that a more accurate updated understanding of human sexuality will lead us to have greater tolerance for ourselves, for each other, greater respect for unconventional relationship configurations like same-sex marriage or polyamorous unions, and that we’ll finally put to rest the idea that men have some innate instinctive right to monitor and control women’s sexual behavior,” Ryan says. “And we’ll see that it’s not only gay people that have to come out of the closet: we all have closets we have to come out of.”
Below, read up on some more lines of research that suggest out-of-the-box ideas about our sexuality.</p>
<p>Question: Is bisexuality a sexual orientation, something that’s temporary or an outgrowth of the sexual fluidity we all exhibit?</p>
.
<p>Research: In a 2008 study, Lisa M. Diamond of the University of Utah presented the results of a decade-long assessment of nearly 70 women who identified as lesbian, bisexual, or sexually unlabelable. Five times over the course of the study, the women detailed their sexual identities, attractions, behaviors, and their social and familial relationships.</p>
.
<p>Results: Based on Diamond’s findings, bisexuality is not a “transitional stage that women adopt ‘on the way’ to lesbian identification” or an “experimental phase” for heterosexuals. Her results, instead, supported that, “Bisexuality may best be interpreted as a stable pattern of attraction to both sexes in which the specific balance of same-sex to other-sex desires necessarily varies according to interpersonal and situational factors,” she writes.</p>
.
<p>Question: Which comes first—desire or arousal?</p>
.
<p>Research: In a study from 2004, described in this New York Times article, Ellen Laan, Stephanie Both and Mark Spiering of the University of Amsterdam examined participants’ physical responses to sexual images.</p>
.
<p>Results: The research indicates that we respond physically to highly sexual visuals before our mind even engages with them. In other words, desire doesn’t precede arousal—it’s the other way around. And we aren’t even aware it’s happening.</p>
.
<p>Question: Do men and women respond differently to sexual images?</p>
.
<p>Research: The same New York Times article describes an Emory University study that tracked participants’ eye movements and brain activity while they looked at sexually explicit photos.</p>
.
<p>Results: Men and women didn’t have the same reactions, but they might not be the ones you’d expect. Men looked at the faces in the photographs much more than women did, and everyone quickly flipped past close-ups of genitalia. Brain activity was gender-dependent: in particular, men had a lot more activity in the amygdala than women did.</p>
.
<p>Question: Does geography influence the body types we idealize and are attracted to?</p>
.
<p>Research: There’s a lot written about the effects of culture and media on the bodily standards we uphold. But the International Body Project, a survey of 7,434 people worldwide, aimed to investigate whether there were more base-level factors motivating our ideal body types, too.</p>
.
<p>Results: The researchers found that places with low socioeconomic status tended to value heavier female body types, while places with high socioeconomic status tended to favor thinner bodies—possibly because body fat acts as an indicator of status when resources are scarce. And the effect of media shouldn’t be underestimated: “Our results show that body dissatisfaction and desire for thinness is commonplace in high-SES settings across world regions, highlighting the need for international attention to this problem,” the researchers write.</p>
.
<p>Question: Do men and women have different sex drives?</p>
.
<p>Research: A recent New York Times Magazine article describes a University of Wisconsin, Madison “meta-analysis” of more than 800 studies of our sexual habits conducted over 15 years.</p>
.
<p>Results: The researchers found that “the evidence for an inborn disparity in sexual motivation is debatable,” the Times Magazine piece reports. The study “suggests that the very statistics evolutionary psychologists use to prove innate difference — like number of sexual partners or rates of masturbation — are heavily influenced by culture. All scientists really know is that the disparity in desire exists, at least after a relationship has lasted a while.” Women’s desire does decrease, but not as a matter of course—as a result of monogamy in particular.</p>
 
 
<p>HEALTH: 8 ways sex affects your brain
By Amanda Gardner
Published February 05, 2015</p>

<p>Understanding how sex affects your brain can improve your roll in the hay, and it may also shed light on other parts of your health, said Barry R. Komisaruk, distinguished professor of psychology at Rutgers University in Newark, New Jersey. It's not the easiest subject to study—test subjects might have to masturbate in an MRI machine—so research is still developing. But scientists are starting to unravel the mystery. Here's what we know so far about your brain on sex.
Sex is like a drug
Sex makes us feel good. That's why we want it, like it, and spend so much time hunting for mates. The pleasure we get from sex is largely due to the release of dopamine, a neurotransmitter that activates the reward center of the brain. Dopamine is also one of the chemicals responsible for the high people get on certain drugs.
"Taking cocaine and having sex don't feel exactly the same, but they do involve the same [brain] regions as well as different regions of the brain," said Dr. Timothy Fong, associate professor of psychiatry at UCLA's David Geffen School of Medicine.
Caffeine, nicotine, and chocolate also tickle the reward center, said Komisaruk.</p>

<p>Sex can act like an antidepressant
A 2002 study out of the University at Albany looked at 300 women and found that those who had sex without a condom had fewer depressive symptoms than women who did use a condom. The researchers hypothesized that various compounds in semen, including estrogen and prostaglandin, have antidepressant properties, which are then absorbed into the body after sex. (They corrected for other things that might affect both mood and condom use, such as being in a serious relationship or use of oral contraceptives.) This is good news for anyone who is in a committed relationship, but if you're still playing the field, then you shouldn't give up condoms. There are other ways to boost mood, but really no other way to prevent sexually transmitted diseases.
Sex can (sometimes) be a downer
Those feel-good chemicals may be going full blast during the act, but after? According to researchers, there is such a thing as post-sex blues (technical term: postcoital dysphoria). About one-third of the women participating in one study reported having experienced sadness after sex at some point in time. While it's possible that regret or feeling coerced might be the reason why, researchers can't explain the connection at this point for sure.</p>

<p>Sex relieves pain
Don't skip sex when you have a headache. Research shows that doing the deed may relieve your symptoms. In a 2013 German study, 60 percent of participants who had migraines and 30 percent of cluster-headache sufferers who had sex during a headache episode reported partial or total relief. Other studies have found that women who stimulated an area of the G spot had an elevation in pain threshold.
"It took greater pain stimulus for them to feel the pain," said Beverly Whipple, a professor emerita at Rutgers University who has conducted some research on the topic.
Whipple didn't study why this was so, but other researchers have attributed the effect to oxytocin, the so-called bonding hormone that helps mothers and babies bond and which also has pain-relieving properties.
Sex can wipe your memory clean
Each year, fewer than 7 people per 100,000 experience "global transient amnesia," a sudden but temporary loss of memory that can't be attributed to any other neurological condition. The condition can be brought on by vigorous sex, as well as emotional stress, pain, minor head injuries, medical procedures, and jumping into hot or cold water. The forgetfulness can last a few minutes or a few hours. During an episode, a person cannot form new memories or remember very recent events. Fortunately, there seem to be no lasting effects.</p>

<p>Sex may boost your memory
Or at least it might if you're a rodent. A 2010 study found that, compared with rats who were allowed only one one-night stand, rodents who engaged in "chronic" sex (once a day for 14 consecutive days) grew more neurons in the hippocampus, a region of the brain associated with memory. The findings were backed up by a second study, also in mice. It remains to be seen if regular sex also has this effect in humans (but you can always tell yourself it does).
Sex calms you down
The same study that linked frequent sex to a brain boost in rats also found that the rats were less stressed. This works for humans, too. One study found that people who'd just had sexual intercourse had better responses to stressful situations like public speaking than people who had not, or who had engaged in other types of sexual activity. How did sex ease stress? In this case, by lowering blood pressure.
Sex makes you sleepy
Sex is more likely to make men sleepy than women, and scientists think they know why: The part of the brain known as the prefrontal cortex winds down after ejaculation. This, along with the release of oxytocin and serotonin, may account for the "rolling over and falling asleep" syndrome.</p>
